                        <p>I think in this life time is the most precious thing that is not gonna ever come back, and I am really aware of it so I like to spend my valuable times doing things that I love, and Software Engineering is one of them. I love Software Engineering because when I am working on bugs or problems I feel like I am alive and I am doing something for humanity. And I think it's the purpose of this life.

                        <p>I am really interested in any part of software development, recently I started working on self driving car technologies because I think it is the future ,but besides that I also really like to build web applications, especially with Graphql. During my internship I can work on any technologies. I think I am a quick learner and I always try to be out of my comfort zone , so I wouldn't mind working with new technologies.</p>
                        <span class = 'line'></span>
                        <p>If I have a chance to work with your team, I really want to learn how software development life cycle works and understand how actually it helps us to build applications. I also really want to improve my teamwork abilities and build applications that actually help Lob.</p>
